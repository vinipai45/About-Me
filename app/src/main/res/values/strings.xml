    <string name="about_bill">William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, software developer, investor, and philanthropist.
        \n He is best known as the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation.
        \nDuring his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.
        \nHe is one of the best-known entrepreneurs and pioneers of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.
        \nBorn and raised in Seattle, Washington, Gates co-founded Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen in 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it went on to become the world\'s largest personal computer software company.
        \nGates led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, but he remained chairman and became chief software architect.
        \nDuring the late 1990s, Gates had been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive.
        \nThis opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.
        \nIn June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation that he and his wife, Melinda Gates, established in 2000.
        \nHe gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie.
        \nHe stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.
